# SmartSupply: Hybrid-DB Supply Chain AI Agent API

## Project Overview
SmartSupply is a robust FastAPI microservice designed to transform how supply chain managers interact with data. By integrating **PostgreSQL** for transactional inventory management and **MongoDB** for flexible audit logging, it provides a reliable and scalable foundation. The core of SmartSupply is an **Autonomous AI Agent** (built with LangChain/LangGraph) that empowers users to query stock levels and report anomalies using natural language.
